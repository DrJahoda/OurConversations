Yes, if you select public for your OurConversations repository, I (as GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant) will be able to "see," "read," and "access" the files and content in that repository whenever you reference them in our conversation.

If the repository is private, I will not be able to access its content directly unless you paste the content here or grant Copilot Chat explicit access through supported GitHub integrations (if available to you).

So, for seamless assistance and automation, making OurConversations public is the best option. Let me know when itâ€™s set up, or if you need help automating the upload or organization of your conversations!
OurConversations are public
